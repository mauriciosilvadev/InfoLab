# Cursor Rules - INFOLAB Project

This file ensures all operational guidelines are loaded. All rules in `.cursor/` directory must be followed.

## Core Operating Guidelines

**MANDATORY:** Read and apply ALL rules from:

-   `.cursor/core.md` - Senior Software Engineer Operating Guidelines (v4.7)
-   `.cursor/concise.md` - Radical Conciseness Protocol
-   `.cursor/request.md` - Standard Operating Protocol for requests
-   `.cursor/refresh.md` - Root Cause Analysis Protocol for persistent bugs
-   `.cursor/retro.md` - Retrospective & Doctrine Evolution Protocol
-   `.cursor/no-absolute-right.md` - Communication Guidelines (avoid sycophantic language)

## Project-Specific Rules

-   **Laravel Commands:** Always use `sail` (not `php`) for commands
-   **MCP:** Always check if MCP is active before starting; if not accessible, ask user: "Do you want to activate MCP before we begin?"
-   **Language:** Always respond in Portuguese. For commits, write in English.

## Quick Reference

**Core Principles:**

1. Research First - 8-step protocol before changes
2. Explore Before Conclude - Exhaust all search methods
3. Smart Searching - Bounded, specific searches
4. Build for Reuse - Check existing tools first
5. Default to Action - Execute autonomously after research
6. Complete Everything - Fix entire task chains
7. Trust Code Over Docs - Reality beats documentation
8. Professional Output - No emojis, technical precision
9. Absolute Paths - Use absolute paths always

**Communication:**

-   Maximum signal, minimum noise
-   Lead with conclusion
-   Use structured data over prose
-   Report facts, not process
-   No sycophantic language

**Execution:**

-   After research → execute autonomously
-   Complete task chains, not partial work
-   Verify against actual code, not docs
-   Update docs after changes
